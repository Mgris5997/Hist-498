# Cold Damage Disorders
 [Cold Damage Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghan_Lun) are a large category of disorders with a wide range of symptoms, most notably with “hot sensations” near the onset of the disease ranging from the common cold to typhoid type symptoms in the early stages. Eventually, it could  lead to death if the disease is not treated or treated poorly.

## Population growth leading to more disease

The Song Dynasty was characterized by a large rise in population, which happened for many reasons.  One of the most prominent being the boom in population during this time. The population growth was a result of the over-maturing of Champa rice, a staple in the diet of many Chinese people. Champa rice was known for its ability to withstand both droughts and flooding and high and low temperatures while also having a high yield for the amount of space that it took up. Because of these factors, rice became a staple food in all of Asia that would reduce fears of food insecurity since it is such a resistant crop. Rapid expansion of rice production came about because of new inventions of iron tools and improvements in “water control, farm implements, draft animals, planting methods, weed and pest control, manuring and seed selection”, all of which created the “Green Revolution”. Since the Chinese could comfortably feed more people, birth rate increased and death rate decreased, resulting in a population boom that aided the spread of disease.
