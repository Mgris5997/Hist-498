# Cold Damage Disorders
 [Cold Damage Disorders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghan_Lun) are a large category of disorders with a wide range of symptoms, most notably with “hot sensations” near the onset of the disease ranging from the common cold to typhoid type symptoms in the early stages. Eventually, it could  lead to death if the disease is not treated or treated poorly.

# Basic usage

## Introduction

The Song Dynasty, years 960 through 1279 was wrought with disease to the point of epidemic and great change. Population change, political discourse, and the current view of medicine had created a perfect environment for Cold Damage Disorders to thrive.[^1]

## Shuwei had shown to know a lot about medicine

One of the case studies that Shuwei had written about in his case studies details the story of a man who is suffering from a cold damage disorder who Shuwei treats with a red peony root, and speaks about how it was beneficial despite the medical knowledge. The red and white peony roots and their different functions had long been discussed by medical scholars but Shuwei had used this opportunity in his treatise to clear up the misconceptions about the plant and describe their different uses.

## Population growth leading to more disease

The Song Dynasty was characterized by a large rise in population, which happened for many reasons.  One of the most prominent being the boom in population during this time. The population growth was a result of the over-maturing of Champa rice, a staple in the diet of many Chinese people. Champa rice was known for its ability to withstand both droughts and flooding and high and low temperatures while also having a high yield for the amount of space that it took up. Because of these factors, rice became a staple food in all of Asia that would reduce fears of food insecurity since it is such a resistant crop. Rapid expansion of rice production came about because of new inventions of iron tools and improvements in “water control, farm implements, draft animals, planting methods, weed and pest control, manuring and seed selection”, all of which created the “Green Revolution”. Since the Chinese could comfortably feed more people, birth rate increased and death rate decreased, resulting in a population boom that aided the spread of disease.

## Effects of Cold Damage Disorders on the Medical Community

Cold damage disorders were a result of the tough times happening in China, such as the population change, trade routes, and government turbulence. In response to this the government and individuals, such as Xu Shuwei, had expanded the knowledge of medicine in order to help treat those around him. Despite the horrors of epidemics and the effects of cold damage disorders, it had resulted in a better understanding that others would be able to build upon in the future for years to come.
